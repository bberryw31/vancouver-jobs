# Vancouver Jobs üçÅ

A simple automated job scraper for Vancouver tech companies.

## Why This Project?

I've been using job listing websites to find opportunities, but realized that companies often post their openings on their official websites first. This project automatically monitors Vancouver tech companies' career pages to catch new job postings as soon as they're available.

All scraping is done respectfully, following each company's `robots.txt` guidelines.
